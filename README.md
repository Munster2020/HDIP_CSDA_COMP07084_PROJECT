# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Fundamentals of Data Analysis (COMP07084) - Project 2020
This module was an introduction to the fundamentals of data analysis, including the acquisition, cleaning and exploration of data sets. As part of the assessment we had to complete four tasks outlined below.

### 1. Repository Structure
1. Readme:
[README.md](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/blob/main/README.md)

2. Jupyter Notebook:
[project2020.ipynb](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/blob/main/project2020.ipynb)

3. PDF of Jupyter Notebook:
[project2020.pdf](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/blob/main/project2020.pdf)

4. Images Folder
[images](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/tree/main/images)

4. Power Production CSV
[powerproduction.csv](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/blob/main/powerproduction.csv)

If you have any issues viewing tasks2020.ipynb in github you can use Jupyter NBViewer which is a web application behind The Jupyter Notebook Viewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

### 2. Software used

![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP07084_PROJECT/blob/main/images/JupyterN.png "Jupyter")
![Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. (Source:downloads.com)

![Cmdr](https://cmder.net/) provides you with an alternative to the Windows default command prompt utility through a more capable console emulator that also comes packing a good-looking graphical user interface. (Source:downloads.com)

### 3. Project

__Problem statement__: In this project we had to perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle.

The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis. Our submission had be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:

- Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
- In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
- Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance our submission, we had to consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set.

The project is divided into nine sections outlined below.

__1.0__ Wind Energy

__2.0__ Simple Linear Regression

__3.0__ Importing the required libraries

__4.0__ Creating dataframe

__5.0__ Data exploration

__6.0__ Summary statistics

__7.0__ Simple linear regression algorithm

__8.0__ Polynomial regression algorithm

__9.0__ References
