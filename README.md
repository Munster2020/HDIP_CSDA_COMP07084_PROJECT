# Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics)
## Fundamentals of Data Analysis (COMP07084) - Project 2020
This module was an introduction to the fundamentals of data analysis, including the acquisition, cleaning and exploration of data sets. As part of the assessment we had to complete four tasks outlined below.

### 1. Repository Structure
1. Readme:
[README.md](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/README.md)

2. Jupyter Notebook:
[project2020.ipynb](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/project2020.ipynb)

3. Excel version of simulated data:
[simulated_data.xlsx](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/simulated_data.xlsx)

4. Images Folder

If you have any issues viewing tasks2020.ipynb in github you can use Jupyter NBViewer which is a web application behind The Jupyter Notebook Viewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

### 2. Software used

![logo](https://github.com/Munster2020/HDIP_CSDA_COMP08050_PROJECT/blob/main/images/JupyterN.png "Jupyter")
![Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. (Source:downloads.com)

### 3. Project

__Problem statement__: For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon ofyour choosing.  You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that isof interest to you in your personal or professional life.  Then, rather than collect datarelated to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.We suggest you use thenumpy.randompackage for this purpose.Specifically, in this project you should:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

- Investigate  the  types  of  variables  involved,  their  likely  distributions,  and  their relationships with each other.

- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.  Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files.  It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.

The project is divided into nine sections outlined below.
